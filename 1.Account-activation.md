### Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account with $300 Free Credit

**Sign Up for GCP**:
   - Go to [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com) and click **Get Started for Free**.

**Sign in with Google**:
   - Use an existing Google account or create a new one.
**Step 1 of 2 Account information**:
   - Enter basic info, including country, agree to the terms, and click "Agree & Continue".

**Step 2 of 2 Payment information verification**: **(Tricky Part)**
   - Use a valid credit/debit card for identity verification (in my case `credit card` worked but 4 different `debit cards` were rejected).
   - Add a Payment Profile (User's Info)
   - Add a Payment Method (Card Info) and submit.
   - A temporary charge will be deducted from your account.
   - To verify your bank account for a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, you can use a `six-digit code` that appears on your `bank statement` after a temporary charge.
   - Enter this six-digit code and submit.
   - Youâ€™ll get **$300 in free credits** valid for **90 days**.

**Note**: After 90 days or once the credits are used up, the account will only incur charges if you choose to upgrade to a paid account.

**Explore GCP**:
   - Use the **Cloud Console** to create projects and start using services with your free credit.
