To log in to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a service account, you can follow these steps. This approach is commonly used for automated tasks in DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, or other non-interactive scripts. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. **Create a Service Account and Key in GCP Console**
   - Go to the **IAM & Admin** section in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Select **Service Accounts**.
   - Click **Create Service Account**.
     - Enter the **name** and **description**.
   - Assign the necessary **roles** that provide the required permissions (e.g.,
     `Compute Admin`,
     `Storage Admin`,
     `Service Usage Admin` etc.).
   - Click **Continue** and then **Done**.
   - Click on the service account you created, navigate to **Keys** > **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
     - Select **JSON** format.
     - Download the key; this JSON file contains the credentials needed to authenticate.

### 2. **Authenticate Using the Service Account Key**
Once you have the JSON key, use the `gcloud` CLI to authenticate with it.

#### Using `gcloud auth activate-service-account` command
   ```bash
   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file <path-to-key-file>.json
   ```

   Replace `<path-to-key-file>.json` with the path to the downloaded JSON key.

#### Example:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ~/path/to/my-service-account-key.json
   ```

### 3. **Set a Default Project (Optional but Recommended)**
   You can specify the default GCP project so you don’t have to pass it every time.

   ```bash
   gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
   ```

   Replace `<your-project-id>` with the ID of your GCP project.

### 4. **Verify Authentication**
   To confirm that the authentication was successful and your credentials are being used, you can list your active credentials:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth list
   ```

   You should see the service account email listed as the active credential.

### 5. **Test Access with a GCP Command**
   Run a simple `gcloud` command, like listing storage buckets, to test if the authentication works:

   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances list
   ```

If the service account has sufficient permissions, you should see the relevant output without any errors.

### Example Use in a Script
For automation, you could include these steps in a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Authenticate with service account
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ~/path/to/my-service-account-key.json

# Set default project
gcloud config set project your-project-id

# Run a GCP command
gcloud compute instances list
```

## Example: Add Permission Roles

To add the **Kubernetes Engine Developer** role to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account, you can use either the **Google Cloud Console** or the **gcloud CLI**. Here are both methods:

### 1. Using Google Cloud Console

1. Go to the **IAM & Admin** page in the Google Cloud Console: [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin).
2. Select your project if it isn’t already selected.
3. Find the service account to which you want to add the **Kubernetes Engine Developer** role. You may need to scroll or search for the account.
4. Click on **Edit principal** (the pencil icon) next to the service account.
5. In the **Role** dropdown, type **Kubernetes Engine Developer** to locate the role.
6. Select **Kubernetes Engine Developer** from the list.
7. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### 2. Using gcloud CLI

Alternatively, you can use the `gcloud` command-line tool to add the **Kubernetes Engine Developer** role to a service account.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command, replacing `PROJECT_ID` with your project ID and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` with your service account's email address:

   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
     --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
     --role="roles/container.developer"
   ```

   - `PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the GCP project.
   - `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email address of your service account, usually formatted as `service-account-name@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

3. Press **Enter** to execute the command. You should see a confirmation message if the role was successfully added.

After adding the role, the service account will have the necessary permissions to develop and manage resources on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** in the project.

This will allow you to authenticate and interact with GCP resources securely and programmatically using a service account.
