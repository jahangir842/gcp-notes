If your goal is to log in to GCP with `gcloud` for authentication and then run commands on a VM, you can adjust the GitLab pipeline to include `gcloud` authentication steps. This way, you’ll be able to securely interact with GCP resources using the SDK.

Here’s a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that authenticates to GCP using a service account, logs in via SSH, and executes `gcloud` commands on the VM.

### Steps to Set Up the GitLab Pipeline

#### 1. **Create and Download a GCP Service Account Key**

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in your GCP console.
2. Create a new service account or select an existing one.
3. Grant it the necessary permissions (e.g., `Compute Admin` or `Viewer` depending on the actions you need).
4. Generate a JSON key for the service account and download it.

#### 2. **Add GitLab CI/CD Variables**

In GitLab, go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables** and add the following:

- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Paste the contents of the service account JSON key.
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID.
- `GCP_VM_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private SSH key to access your GCP VM.
- `GCP_VM_USER`: The username for SSH access to the VM (e.g., `ubuntu`).
- `GCP_VM_IP`: The external IP address of your GCP VM.

#### 3. **Define the Pipeline in `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

Here’s an example `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration to authenticate with GCP and use `gcloud` commands:

```yaml
stages:
  - auth
  - run_commands

authenticate_gcp:
  stage: auth
  image: google/cloud-sdk:latest  # Use Google Cloud SDK image
  script:
    # Save the GCP service account key to a file
    - echo "$GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" | base64 -d > "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/gcp-key.json"
    
    # Authenticate with GCP using the service account key
    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file="$CI_PROJECT_DIR/gcp-key.json"
    
    # Set the default project
    - gcloud config set project "$GCP_PROJECT_ID"
    
  only:
    - main  # Or any other branch you want this to run on

run_gcloud_commands_on_vm:
  stage: run_commands
  image: google/cloud-sdk:latest  # Use Google Cloud SDK image
  before_script:
    # Save the SSH private key to a file
    - echo "$GCP_VM_PRIVATE_KEY" | tr -d '\r' > /tmp/gcp_vm_key
    - chmod 600 /tmp/gcp_vm_key
    
  script:
    # SSH into the VM and run gcloud commands
    - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /tmp/gcp_vm_key "$GCP_VM_USER@$GCP_VM_IP" << 'EOF'
      # Authenticate within the VM for gcloud commands
      echo "$GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" | base64 -d > /tmp/gcp-key.json
      gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/tmp/gcp-key.json
      gcloud config set project "$GCP_PROJECT_ID"
      
      # Run your gcloud commands here
      gcloud compute instances list  # Example command
      gcloud compute disks list      # Another example
      
      # Clean up the service account key from the VM
      rm /tmp/gcp-key.json
    EOF
    
  after_script:
    # Clean up the SSH key file after job completion
    - rm /tmp/gcp_vm_key
    
  only:
    - main
```

### Explanation of the Pipeline

1. **Authentication Stage (`authenticate_gcp`)**:
   - Uses the **Google Cloud SDK Docker image**.
   - Activates the GCP service account using the JSON key and sets the project. This step ensures GitLab CI has access to your GCP environment.

2. **Run Commands on VM Stage (`run_gcloud_commands_on_vm`)**:
   - Uses the same **Google Cloud SDK Docker image**.
   - SSHs into the VM and authenticates with GCP inside the VM by storing and using the service account key. This way, the VM can execute `gcloud` commands directly.
   - Runs any specified `gcloud` commands, such as listing instances or disks.
   - Deletes the service account JSON key from the VM after commands are run for security.

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Cleans up the SSH key and service account key to prevent unauthorized access.

### Automating Execution

You can schedule this pipeline in **CI/CD > Schedules** if you need it to run periodically to perform regular GCP actions.

This setup will allow you to interact with your GCP resources on a VM without repeated manual login steps, keeping everything secure and automated. Let me know if you have specific `gcloud` commands or additional requirements!
