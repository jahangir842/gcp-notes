i have a laptop with windows installed, on which i have installed superputty, i access a linux vm from this superputty, in that linux vm i run "gcloud auth login --console-only" command, then I copy the link and put in your browser, and complete the sign-in prompts, now gcp login is successful, now I run command "kubectl get pods", how can I perform this whole operation with a gitlab pipeline

---

To set up this operation in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, we need to accomplish these tasks:

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud** in a non-interactive way.
2. **Set up kubectl** to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Run the `kubectl` commands** to manage your Kubernetes resources.

Here's a guide to accomplish this:

### Steps

1. **Create a Service Account in Google Cloud Platform**: This service account will be used to authenticate in the pipeline without requiring an interactive login.

    - In GCP, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
    - Create a service account with the required permissions to access your Kubernetes cluster (for example, the `Kubernetes Engine Developer` role).
    - After creating the account, go to **Keys** > **Add Key** > **Create New Key** and select JSON. Download the JSON key file.

2. **Store the Service Account Key in GitLab**:
    - Go to your GitLab repository.
    - Navigate to **Settings** > **CI / CD** > **Variables**.
    - Add a new variable named `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and paste the content of the JSON key file as the value.

3. **Configure Your GitLab CI Pipeline**: Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository to set up the pipeline steps.

Here's an example of what the pipeline configuration might look like:

```yaml
stages:
  - setup
  - deploy

variables:
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /tmp/gcp-key.json

before_script:
  - echo "$GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" > $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  - gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
  - gcloud config set compute/zone <YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE>

setup_kubectl:
  stage: setup
  script:
    # Install kubectl if it's not available in the environment
    - |
      if ! command -v kubectl &> /dev/null; then
        curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
        chmod +x ./kubectl
        mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
      fi
    # Install gcloud CLI if it's not available in the environment
    - |
      if ! command -v gcloud &> /dev/null; then
        curl -sSL https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
        exec -l $SHELL
        gcloud components install kubectl
      fi
    # Authenticate to GKE and get cluster credentials
    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> --zone <YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE> --project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl get pods
```

### Explanation

1. **Variables**: Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the JSON key file.
2. **Service Account Authentication**: Using the `gcloud auth activate-service-account` command, authenticate using the service account key.
3. **Install and Configure kubectl**:
   - Install `kubectl` if it’s not already present in the environment.
   - Use `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` to authenticate and configure `kubectl` to access your GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster.
4. **Run kubectl commands**: In the `deploy` job, use `kubectl get pods` to list the pods in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Notes

- Replace placeholders (`<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`, `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE>`, `<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>`) with your actual GCP project information.
- Ensure that the runner environment has the required permissions and network access to GCP.

This setup will allow GitLab CI to automatically authenticate, connect to your Kubernetes cluster, and run the `kubectl` commands as you specified.

## VM as Runner:

To run these commands on your own Ubuntu VM, you can configure the VM as a **self-hosted GitLab Runner**. This will let your GitLab pipeline jobs run directly on your VM, so any commands (like `kubectl`) will execute in that environment.

### Steps to Set Up Your Ubuntu VM as a GitLab Runner

1. **Install GitLab Runner on Your VM**:
   - SSH into your Ubuntu VM.
   - Follow the official [GitLab Runner installation guide for Ubuntu](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository.html):
     ```bash
     curl -L --output /usr/local/bin/gitlab-runner https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitlab-runner
     ```

2. **Register the Runner with Your GitLab Project**:
   - After installation, register your GitLab Runner to link it to your GitLab project. Use the following command on your VM:
     ```bash
     sudo gitlab-runner register
     ```
   - During registration, you’ll need:
     - The **GitLab instance URL** (e.g., `https://gitlab.com`).
     - A **registration token**, found in **Settings > CI / CD > Runners** in your GitLab project.
     - **Executor type**: Choose `shell` if you want jobs to run directly on the VM without containerization.
   - This setup allows jobs to use the environment of your VM directly.

3. **Update Your .gitlab-ci.yml File**:
   - Now that your runner is registered, you can use the same `.gitlab-ci.yml` file as before. It will run directly on your VM and use any tools installed there, such as `kubectl` or `gcloud`.
   - You don’t need to install `kubectl` in every pipeline job if it’s already installed on your VM; you can remove the installation lines from the YAML file.
  
---

Since you’ll be using your own Ubuntu VM as the GitLab Runner, the pipeline can be simplified. We can skip installing `kubectl` and `gcloud` in each job since they are already set up on your VM.

Here’s a streamlined `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

before_script:
  # Authenticate with GCP
  - echo "$GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" > /tmp/gcp-key.json
  - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/tmp/gcp-key.json
  - gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
  - gcloud config set compute/zone <YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE>

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    # Configure kubectl to access the cluster
    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> --zone <YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE> --project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    # Run any kubectl commands here
    - kubectl get pods
```

### Explanation

1. **before_script**:
   - Sets up Google Cloud authentication using the service account key stored as a GitLab CI/CD variable.
   - Configures the GCP project and zone for `gcloud` commands.

2. **deploy Job**:
   - Fetches the credentials for your Kubernetes cluster using `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`, enabling `kubectl` to communicate with the cluster.
   - Runs `kubectl get pods` to list the pods in your cluster. You can replace this with any other `kubectl` commands as needed.

### GitLab CI/CD Variables

- In your GitLab project’s settings, go to **Settings > CI / CD > Variables**.
- Add `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` as a variable, with the content of your Google Cloud service account JSON key.

### Notes

- Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`, `<YOUR_COMPUTE_ZONE>`, and `<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>` with your actual Google Cloud project and Kubernetes cluster details.
- Since this runner is set up on your VM, each command will run in the VM environment directly, allowing seamless access to `gcloud` and `kubectl`.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Commit and push your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to trigger the pipeline.
   - The registered runner (your VM) will pick up the job and execute the commands directly on the VM.

With this setup, `kubectl` and `gcloud` will run on your Ubuntu VM whenever a job is triggered, allowing you to interact with your Kubernetes cluster as you would locally.
